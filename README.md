# Improved Rails: A BTA Mod
Refer to the post I made on Discord (the mod-suggestions channel) for proper information on this. If you're not on the Discord... how'd you end up here in the first place?
Wiki coming eventually. Got a basic WIP wiki going right now, but no guarantees it'll actually be finished.

Oh yeah, props to Tocinin for lettin' me use those ingot/block textures. And more props to UselessSolutions's Moonsteel mod, for it's source code kinda helped me figure out how basic items are implemented.
